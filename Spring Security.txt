Spring Security:-

Why:-
	Security is important to protect our application from attackers and to protect our data.


What will happen if we dont focus on security:-
	
	Protection:- Any one can able to login and can access any resource.
	
	Trust:- Will loose trust of users if everybody is aware that our application is not secure.
	
	Integrity:- An attacker can replace our resources with the faulty one.

Spring Security key compontents:-
	Authentication:- It checks who you are?
	Authorization:- It check what actions you allowed after checking who you are.
