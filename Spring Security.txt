Spring Security:-

Why:-
	Security is important to protect our application from attackers and to protect our data.


What will happen if we dont focus on security:-
	
	Protection:- Any one can able to login and can access any resource.
	
	Trust:- Will loose trust of users if everybody is aware that our application is not secure.
	
	Integrity:- An attacker can replace our resources with the faulty one.

Spring Security key compontents:-
	Authentication:- It checks who you are?
	Authorization:- It check what actions you allowed after checking who you are.
	
	
How Spring Security works internally?

Key compontents:-
Request
Response
Filter chain
Authentication Filter
Authentication Manager
Authentication Provider
	Password Encode
	UserDetailsService
Security context	

1. Request:- Any HTTP request that we hit eg:- login,getting some information of users.
2. Filter chain:- Any request that hit are pass through the filter chain series.

3. Authentication filter:- So authentication filter intercepts the request and grab the username and password from the authentication request
							and package them into the object.i.e Create a authentication Object.

4. Authentication Manager:- Once the authentication Object is created then the job of Authentication Manager comes into picture.
							Authentication Manager decides what to do with this authentication Object which include username and password.
							Authentication Manager deligate the task to authenticate user to the Authentication Provider.

5. Authentication Provider:-Authentication Provider is responsible to check whether the give authenticatation credentials are correct or not.
							To authenticate user credentials, provider needs two things 1. Password Encoder and 2.UserDetailsService

							Password Encoder:- As user submit the username and password the password must be in plain text
												and to compare the provided credentials with the stored one we need to Encode the plain text password
												because in database we stored a hashed password.
							UserDetailsService:- It is mainly use for fetching the user records from the datasource eg,InMeomory,database like mysql,postgress etc.
												 From the Authentication Object it takes the username and with the help of username it will find the 
												 entire record of user with its User Role as well. The object that returns from the service is called UserDetails Object.

			After authenticating the user the Authentication provider pass on the complete Authentication Object which include username,password,User Role etc to the Authentication Manager 

6. Security Context:-
		1.Holds the Authentication Object:- It holds the entire user information like username,password role for further use.

		2. Global Access:- These information are available through out the application using SecurityContextHolder, as the user will send subsequent requests. To access other resources.

		3. Use for Authorization:- as the object is available gloabally for every resource we can check whether the user has right permission to access it or not.



(Note):-
	When a user makes a login request, Spring Security checks if an Authentication object is present in the SecurityContextHolder.
If not, the AuthenticationManager is invoked to authenticate the user via the configured AuthenticationProvider. Upon successful authentication, an Authentication object is created and stored in the SecurityContext via the SecurityContextHolder.
For subsequent requests, Spring Security retrieves the Authentication object from the SecurityContextHolder to perform authorization checks and determine access permissions based on the user's roles and authorities.



Date:- 19/01/2025:-

Spring boot basic authentication


SpringBootWebSecurityConfiguration:- The file in which default authentication and Form based authentication is enabled.


To set our Custom Security Configuration following are the steps:
1. Create a new class and annotate it with @Configuration as we specifying the security configuration and @EnableWebSecurity.
2. We need to copy the method named "defaultSecurityFilterChain" and annotate it with @Bean.


Basic vs Form Based Authentication:-

In Basic authentication we don't have any UI and any logout page. To close the session we have to close the tab.

If we inspect out login activity in basic authentication we can see in Authorization key we can see some encrypted value it is nothing but your username and password in Base64 format.


So I have created a custom SecurityConfig class in which I have removed the Form based authentication and keep basic authentication.

Also I have to make my each API request Stateless, which means there is no connection between client and server and no API is related to each other.



Date:- 20/01/2025
Will use In Memory database to store multiple users and will assign them ROLE as well.




Date: 21/01/2025:-Added mysql database into the project

Added MYSQL and Data JPA dependencies, configure application.properties file.
In SecurityConfig class intially I was returning InMemoryUserManager object but now we have to use "JDBCUserDetailsManager"

We have to pass the Datasource object as a argument to the JDBCUserDetailsManager constructor.
DataSource is nothing but our external database Mysql configuration.
Will Annotate it with @Autowire so that spring boot will automatically inject the dependency.

After providing the dataSource object just need to call createUser method same as InMemoryUserManager.

We have to create two table that are users,authorities to store the information.
The schema scripts will be get from official Github Spring scerity page:-
Link:- https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/main/core/src/main/resources/org/springframework/security/core/userdetails/jdbc/users.ddl

just need to run this command in our database.


What is Hashing:-
Need to trasmit  the original message to some completly different format. It is one way process.

Algorithms uses by Hashing



Date:- 22/01/2025:- JWT

Without JWT (JSON Web Token):-
	No advance features like expiration time.
	Can be decoded easily
	
	
How JWT works:-
	1. Users tries to login into system.
	2. Server first authenticate the user, if the credentials are correct it will generate a token and issued to user.
	3. Then for every request along with API the issued token is sent.
	4. Server will check if the token is valid then provide the resoruce, if not error.
	
	
	Token parts:-
	First part is header which includes the type of token and the algorithm which is used to sign.
	Second part is payload which consist the meta-data which may have username,password,roles,permission.
	Third part is signature it is like a secret key which append in entire token
	
	
	Implmentation of JWT in Spring Security.
